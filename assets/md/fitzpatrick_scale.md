# Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale

The Fitzpatrick scale is a scientific classification system that categorizes human skin types based on their response to UV radiation. Developed by dermatologist Thomas B. Fitzpatrick in 1975, this scale is widely used in dermatology and helps determine your risk of skin cancer and sunburn.

## Why This Matters for Mole Tracking

Understanding your skin type helps in several ways:

- **Risk Assessment**: Higher Fitzpatrick types (I-II) have increased melanoma risk
- **Screening Frequency**: Fair-skinned individuals may need more frequent monitoring
- **Sun Protection**: Guides appropriate sunscreen and protective measures
- **Mole Changes**: Different skin types may show changes differently
- **Medical Consultation**: Helps doctors assess your personal risk factors

## Important Notes

- This scale is a general guide - individual responses can vary
- All skin types can develop skin cancer, including melanoma
- Regular mole monitoring is important regardless of skin type
- Consult a dermatologist for personalized advice
- Use this information alongside professional medical guidance
