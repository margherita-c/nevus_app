# nevus.app
Nevus is an app whose purpose is to help people check and track the status of their moles. It allows to: 
- take pictures and save them on a private gallery accessible only trough the app, so that they aren't stored in public places
- identify each mole and create a history of evolution of every mole with all the pictures that Nevus has
- place the moles on a human figure, so that its location will be known even without a photo of it
